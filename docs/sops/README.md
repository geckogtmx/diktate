# Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

## Philosophy: The "AI-Pair" Standard

Welcome to the **diktate** operational documentation.

These SOPs are designed with a specific reality in mind: **Modern development is often a partnership between a human and an AI.**

Whether you are a junior developer learning the ropes, a senior engineer delegating tasks, or an AI agent executing instructions, these documents serve as the single source of truth for *how tasks get done*.

### How to use these SOPs

1.  **For Humans**: Read the "Objective" and "Prerequisites". Follow the "Execution Steps" one by one. The steps are designed to be atomic—do one thing, verify it works, move to the next.
2.  **For AI Agents**: These documents act as your **context**. When asked to perform a task (e.g., "Add a new language"), ingest the relevant SOP. The steps provide the exact file paths, code patterns, and verification logic you need to succeed without hallucinating.

### Structure

Every SOP follows a strict schema:
- **Frontmatter**: Metadata for searching and indexing.
- **Objective**: The "Definition of Done".
- **Prerequisites**: What must be true before starting.
- **Execution Steps**: The rigid, linear path to success.
- **Verification**: How to prove the step succeeded.
- **Troubleshooting**: Common pitfalls and their fixes.

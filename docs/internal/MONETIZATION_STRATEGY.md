# dikta.me Anti-Subscription Monetization Strategy

**Philosophy:** One-time payments only. No recurring subscriptions. 25% margins on cloud. We're the good guys.

---

## The Anti-Subscription Manifesto

> "Subscription vampires charge you $100-240 EVERY YEAR for voice dictation.
> We charge $10-25 ONCE. Own it forever. No tricks."

---

## Pricing Tiers

### Libre Tier (Local-Only)

---

### Pro Tier (BYOK + Cloud)
**Price:** $25 one-time
**Target:** Professionals, power users, cloud-enabled workflows

**Everything in Libre, PLUS:**

**Value Proposition:**

---

## Wallet Credits (v1.1 - No Subscriptions!)

> **Radical Transparency:** We keep 25%, you get 75% in compute value.

### Credit Packages

| Package | Price | Estimated Words | Note |
|---------|-------|-----------------|------|
| **Starter** | $5 | 10,000-30,000 | Try cloud computing |
| **Standard** | $10 | 20,000-60,000 | Regular usage |
| **Bulk** | $25 | 50,000-150,000 | Power users |

*Word counts vary by provider (Groq, DeepSeek, Gemini). Credits NEVER expire.*

### Why 25% Margin?

We could charge more. Competitors hide their margins.

We're transparent:
- **Your $10:** $7.50 goes to cloud compute, $2.50 to dikta.me
- **Their $10/month:** Who knows? It's a black box.

---

## 🔄 Active Status (Soft Recurring Revenue)

> Stay active, stay updated. Not a subscription—a choice.

**To receive ongoing updates for Libre & Pro:**

| Method | Requirement | Benefits |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Wallet Balance** | Keep $10+ topped up every 6 months | Updates + usable cloud credits |
| **Ko-fi/Substack** | $2-3/month supporter tier | Updates + community perks |

**Why this model:**
- Users choose their method (wallet vs platform)
- Wallet credits are usable, not wasted
- $20/year vs competitors' $144-240/year
- Creates sustainable recurring revenue ethically

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

**Phase 1 (MVP → Month 3):**
- ✅ **Ko-fi only** (simplest, fastest)
- Free download from GitHub
- Ko-fi link in README and app
- Two tiers: $3/month (Supporter), $12/month (Patron)

**Phase 2 (Months 3-6):**
- ✅ **Add GitHub Sponsors**
- Same tiers as Ko-fi
- Cross-promote both platforms
- Let users choose their preferred platform

**Phase 3 (Months 6-12):**
- ✅ **Add Patreon** (if creating content)
- Start publishing development vlogs, tutorials
- Patreon becomes content hub
- Ko-fi/GitHub for simple donations

**Phase 4 (Year 2+):**
- ✅ **Custom payment system** (if revenue justifies it)
- Migrate to Stripe/Paddle for direct billing
- Keep Ko-fi/GitHub/Patreon as alternatives

---

### Benefits of Platform-Based Approach

**vs. Custom Payment System:**

| Aspect | Custom (Stripe/Paddle) | Platform (Ko-fi/GitHub) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Setup Time** | 2-4 weeks | < 1 hour |
| **Development Cost** | $10K-20K | $0 |
| **Maintenance** | Ongoing (billing, taxes) | Zero (platform handles it) |
| **Fees** | 3-5% | 0-12% |
| **Trust** | Need to build | Instant (established platforms) |
| **Compliance** | You handle (PCI, GDPR) | Platform handles |
| **Tax Reporting** | Complex (1099, VAT) | Simplified |

**For MVP → Phase 2, platforms are clearly superior.**

```

---

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Zero upfront cost** - No payment infrastructure to build

---

### Migration Path to Custom System

- Need advanced features (team billing, usage tracking)
- Want to offer cloud services (API pool)

**How to migrate:**
- Keep platforms as donation options
- Add custom billing for cloud features
- Grandfather existing supporters
- Offer discount for platform supporters

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (MVP): Free Only
- Launch with 100% free, local-first product
- Build community, gather feedback
- Validate product-market fit

### Phase 2 (Months 3-6): Add Plus Tier
- Implement Gemini fallback (BYOK)
- Create shared API pool with fair usage limits
- Add cloud sync for settings
- Launch Plus tier at $12/year

### Phase 3 (Months 6-12): Add Pro Tier
- Implement team features (shared dictionaries)
- Add premium model support (GPT-4, Claude)
- Create analytics dashboard
- Launch Pro tier at $50/year

### Phase 4 (Year 2+): Enterprise
- Custom pricing for large organizations
- On-premise deployment options
- SSO, SAML integration
- Dedicated support

---

## Why This Works

### 1. **Freemium Done Right**
- Free tier is **fully functional** (not crippled)
- Paid tiers add **convenience**, not core features
- No artificial limits (word counts, time limits)

### 2. **Ethical Monetization**
- Users pay for **cloud convenience**, not privacy
- Open source remains open source
- Community-driven development

### 3. **Sustainable Pricing**
- $12/year is **impulse-buy territory** (less than Netflix for 1 month)
- $50/year is **professional** but still 3x cheaper than competitors
- Conversion rates: 15-20% to Plus, 5% to Pro (realistic for freemium)

### 4. **Competitive Moat**
- **Only** open-source solution with this feature set
- **Only** solution with 100% local option at this price
- **Only** solution with "bring your own API key" model

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Conversion Rates
**Mitigation:** Free tier is so good, users don't need to upgrade

**Response:**
- Emphasize **convenience** of cloud fallback
- Add **team features** that require Pro
- Create **value-added services** (analytics, integrations)

### Risk 2: High Cloud API Costs
**Mitigation:** Shared pool gets expensive if many users upgrade

**Response:**
- Fair usage limits on Plus tier
- Encourage BYOK (bring your own key)
- Optimize prompts to reduce token usage
- Cache common transformations

### Risk 3: Competitors Copy Model
**Mitigation:** WisprFlow/Glaido add free local tier

**Response:**
- **Open source** is our moat (they can't copy this)
- **Community** is our advantage (network effects)
- **Speed to market** (ship MVP fast, build community)

---

## Success Metrics

### Year 1
- 10,000 total users
- 15% conversion to Plus ($18K revenue)
- 5% conversion to Pro ($25K revenue)
- Break-even on costs

### Year 3
- 100,000 total users
- 20% conversion to Plus ($240K revenue)
- 5% conversion to Pro ($250K revenue)

- 25% conversion to Plus ($1.5M revenue)
- 10% conversion to Pro ($2.5M revenue)
- $1M+ net profit (hire team, scale)

# Virality Strategy: The "Pay it Forward" Model

> **Status:** CONCEPT
> **Origin:** User Brainstorm (2026-01-21)
> **Goal:** Rapid user acquisition via trusted networks (Streamers/Influencers).

## 1. The Core Concept
Instead of traditional sales, we use a **scarcity-driven viral loop**:
1.  **Seed Users:** We manually select high-leverage users (Streamers, Influencers, Power Users).
2.  **The "Golden Ticket":** Each Seed User gets **5 Invites**.
3.  **The Offer:** "Here is dIKtate for free. You also have 5 codes to give to your mods/community for free."
4.  **Viral Loop:** Those 5 recipients *also* get 5 invites (potentially).

## 2. Implementation Ideas

### A. The "Chain Letter" System
-   **License Keys:** Generating keys that are linked.
    -   Key A (Master) -> Generates Keys A1-A5.
    -   Key A1 -> Generates Keys A1a-A1e.
-   **Benefits:** We can track exactly which "tree" of users came from which influencer.

### B. The "Streamer Special"
-   Give a streamer a specific code (e.g., `NINJA-DIKTATE`).
-   First 100 people to use it get the app for free.
-   Creates urgency ("Claim it before it's gone!").

## 3. Technical Requirements (Future)
-   **Activation Server:** A simple web API to validate keys and check their "invite count".
-   **App Integration:** Validating the key on first run.

## 4. Notes
> "For free. Fuck it. For free."
-   The goal is mass adoption first.
-   Monetization can come later (Pro features, Enterprise support, Custom models), or it remains free and we monetize services.

## 🎉 Exciting Updates: Better Value for Everyone

After deep analysis of our pricing strategy and user feedback, we've made some important discoveries that let us offer **even better value** to our community. Here's what we've learned and implemented:

---

## 🔓 Discovery #1: The "Fair Access" Problem

**The Challenge:** Traditional software pricing creates unfairness. Early buyers pay the same as late buyers who get all the updates for free.

**Our Solution:** We discovered that users actually *want* to support ongoing development, but they need fair pricing that doesn't punish early adopters.

**What This Means for You:**
- **One-time license:** $20 gets you the current version + 1 year of updates
- **No "update taxes"** - you won't pay more for the same features later
- **Clear roadmap:** Major new features come in version upgrades

---

## 🚀 Discovery #2: Community Support Creates Better Software

**The Challenge:** How do we fund ongoing development without expensive subscriptions?

**Our Breakthrough:** We discovered that $2/month on KoFi creates the perfect balance - enough revenue for development, but optional and low-pressure.

**The New KoFi Benefits:**
- **60 days early access** to new features and improvements
- **5 device licenses** (vs 3 for one-time licenses)
- **Beta testing opportunities** - be the first to try new features
- **Direct developer support** and roadmap input

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### For One-Time License Holders ($20)
You get a **complete, professional dictation tool** with:
- Unlimited local processing (your data never leaves your machine)
- Faster than cloud competitors (350-750ms vs 800-2000ms)
- 3 device flexibility for personal use
- 1 year of updates included

### For KoFi Supporters ($2/month)
You get **premium access** plus:
- **60 days early access** - try new features before anyone else
- **5 device licenses** - perfect for families or multi-device setups
- **Beta privileges** - shape the future of dikta.me
- **Community status** - you're supporting independent development

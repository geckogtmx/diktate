# Privacy & Security

dIKtate is built with a "Privacy First" architecture.

## 🔒 The Air-Gap Guarantee
- **100% Offline**: dIKtate operates entirely on your local machine.
- **No Cloud Calls**: Your voice audio never leaves your computer.
- **No Telemetry**: We do not track your usage or collect data.

## 🛡️ SafeStorage
If you choose to use external API keys (optional), they are stored using your OS's native secure credential manager (Windows Credential Locker). They are never saved in plain text files.

## 📝 Log Redaction
All application logs are automatically scrubbed of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and API keys before being written to disk.
